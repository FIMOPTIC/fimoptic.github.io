# About

This project has two main objectives:
- a scientific one, for improving the detection, monitoring, and
  characterization of the slow, transient mechanical processes involved in the
  preparation phase of earthquakes ruptures;
- a technological one, to develop and demonstrate the potential of new, high
  resolution, innovative optical instruments, for contributing to this
  scientific goal.

These precursory, weak strain signals are usually seen as a special
subset of the more general class of “strain transients”, revealing slow
mechanical instabilities in the fault system at depth, in a broad range of
space and time scales. Only a small fraction of those transients may mark the
slow initiation of major seismic ruptures. These weak signals, often depleted
from seismic radiation, and still poorly documented and understood, offer a
unique observational window on the friction characteristics of fault zones,
which is requested for a sound mechanical and probabilistic approach for
failure prediction, and hence relates to the major challenges on the physics of
earthquake forecasting.

The most commonly reported sources of transient strain are slow slip events
(SSE) on fault patches, lasting hours to months, which have been documented
since decades, mostly in the deep subduction interplate, but also in other
tectonic contexts, and in the shallower crust. They are often synchronous to
small amplitude tectonic tremors, but shallow SSEs are mostly coincident to
seismic swarms. The moment magnitude of SSEs detected by GNSS goes rarely down
to 6.5, and many smaller SSEs are expected to occur in fault zones.

Detecting these smaller and expectedly very numerous SSEs would allow a much
more complete characterization of fault friction, populating the large
observational gap in the scaling of the standard « slow earthquakes » family.
Up to now, very few SSEs have been precursor to large earthquakes, although a
slip initiation process might be common before large interplate earthquake, as
inferred from the precursory increase of seismicity rate, and from sequences of
seismic repeaters. The latter, which will will focus on in the project, are
mechanical asperities on a fault surface which break repeatedly, being loaded
by aseismic creep on their surrounding surface, at a rate depending on the
local creeping rate and on their magnitude, therefore often used for
determining the creeping rate of major interplate faults in subduction zones.

In addition to transient slow slip processes, transient pore pressure changes
in fault zones are considered as major cause of natural seismic swarms, as
inferred from space-time dynamics and diffusion of the seismicity, but GNSS
does not resolve their aseismic strain signature. Their direct evidence and
quantification arise from induced and triggered seismicity from controlled
fluid injection and production.

A first, major barrier for any
significant progress in the understanding and mechanical modelling of these
strain transients is the scarcity of the relevant, high resolution records
close enough to the sources: Dense GNSS and INSAR monitoring only detect the
rare largest transients, with moment magnitude Mw> 6-6.5, at the strain level
of 10-6 ; and high resolution instruments, like strainmeters and tiltmeters,
are much less common in field observatories, if not totally absent. This has
several causes: (1), for the boreholes strainmeters, which present the highest
resolution of 10-10 (by integrating the strain over up to 3 m long sensing part
of the probe), the cost is very high: typically a minimum 200 k€ when including
their standard installation in 150-200 m deep boreholes; (2), the tiltmeter
boreholes present a fair resolution of 10-8, but also a high sensitivity to
local noise in the rock (submetric scale) and a poor long term stability
(instrumental drift); (3), long base, hydrostatic tiltmeters have better
performances in resolution (10-10) and in long term stability (10-8 radians per
month) when installed in tunnels, but are much more difficult to install and
are more fragile systems; and (4), common to all these sensors, the difficulty
of the extraction of the relevant signals of internal origin, to be separated
from the influence of earth and sea tide, from external factors (temperature,
air pressure, rain ), and from very local noises in the rock mass; the latter
can be however reduced using long base sensors (tiltmeters or strainmeter).

To be safely identified as a strain signal from deep relevant sources,
synchronous signals should be recorded on arrays of several, distant stations.
This allows to eliminate signals detected on single instruments and produced by
local sources or from the instrument itself, unrelated to deep processes. Owing
to the fast decay of the strain signal with distance d to the source, as d-3,
the distance between station should not exceed much the depth of the sources to
allow for redundancy. Most strain monitoring array lack such densities, due to
both cost and complexity of installation.

In this scientific and instrumental
context of transient strain monitoring in seismically active area, we propose
to overcome these barriers taking advantage of the conjunction of:

1. A privileged access to two sites showing an exceptionally high level of
seismic activity, at two very different scales: the western Corinth rift
(Greece), which is the region with highest microseismic density and strain rate
in the whole Mediterranean, densely monitored by our team (IPGP and ENS) for
the last 20 years; and the deep active mine of Garpenberg (Sweden), monitored
for the last 6 years by the team (INERIS, coll. IPGP), with the rare
opportunity to reach the active fault zone of repeaters.

2. The outcome of 10 years of R&D of our team (ESEO-IPGP-ENS), focussing on
innovative high resolution optical instruments for strain and vibration, which
provide specific assets in terms of cost, resolution, and/or stability, with
respect to commercial ones: one optical long base hydrostatic tiltmeter, one
optical seismometer, and one optical strainmeter, the most recently designed
sensor to be developed in the frame of the present project.

The proper design and adaptation of these three sensor type in the monitoring
of these two selected sites should considerably improve the detection of strain
transients, thus allowing for significant and generic advances on the modelling
of the seismic cycle of asperities and on the unstable seismic- aseismic
coupling in fault zones. As a complementary “product” of the project, the new
instruments will be demonstrated and qualified in the field, and advertised for
being used in other contexts of geo-monitoring in academic or industrial
environment.
