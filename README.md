# FIMOPTIC

FIMOPTIC stands for "Fault Instabilities Monitored by innovative OPTICal
instruments".

The project main goals are:

1. Improving the detection, monitoring, and characterization of the slow,
transient mechanical processes involved in the preparation phase of
earthquakes ruptures.
2. Develop and demonstrate the potential of new, high resolution, innovative
optical instruments.

The project is founded by the Agence Nationale de la recherche (ANR).
